- real time viewer + cam controller
  (real time = GPU)                                     [~]
- use thrust host_vector and pinned_allocator to        [X]
  accelerate data tranfers                              [~]
- use cuda streams (transfer/computation overlap)

- Sort meshes depending on z coord => early discard
- Reduce memory consumption
- Accelerate tile dispatch
