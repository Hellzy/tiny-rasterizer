- .obj parser                                           [~]
- real time viewer + cam controller
  (real time = GPU)                                     [~]
- use thrust host_vector and pinned_allocator to        [X]
  accelerate data tranfers                              [~]
- use cuda streams (transfer/computation overlap)

- Use int/long rather than bool in bitset to avoid a
  full mesh traversal (i.e first value holding -1
  means the end of mesh list)
- Sort meshes depending on z coord => early discard
